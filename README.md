## ✨ How Does it Work? (The Magic Trick!)

It might seem like magic 🔮, but the game uses a mathematical principle based on **binary numbers**. Each set of numbers shown corresponds to a specific 'bit' or place value (1, 2, 4, 8, 16). By knowing which sets your number belongs to (answering "Yes"), the game adds up those place values to reveal the number you were thinking of! Pretty neat, right? 😉
