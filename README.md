## ✨ How Does it Work? (The Magic Trick!)

It might seem like magic 🔮, but the game uses a mathematical principle based on **binary numbers**. Each set of numbers shown corresponds to a specific 'bit' or place value (1, 2, 4, 8, 16). By knowing which sets your number belongs to (answering "Yes"), the game adds up those place values to reveal the number you were thinking of! Pretty neat, right? 😉

## 🚀 Features

* **❓ Interactive Gameplay:** Answer 5 simple "Yes/No" questions.
* **🤯 Mind-Reading Illusion:** Uses a classic mathematical trick to "guess" your number (1-31).
* **🎨 Playful Design:** Features a vibrant, cartoonish interface for a fun experience.
* **💻 Client-Side:** Runs entirely in your browser.
* **🔒 No Data Stored:** Absolutely no information (birthdays or otherwise) is saved or sent anywhere.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **HTML:** Structure of the game page.
